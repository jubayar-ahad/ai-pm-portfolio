# DECISIONS

A log of choices made while executing OBJECTIVE.md. Each entry has an ISO date,
a Decision line, and a Rationale. Decisions are reversible — if a later
iteration finds a better path, append a new entry that overrides the old one
rather than rewriting history, so the change of mind stays auditable.

This file is the agent's contract with the user. Edit it anytime to redirect.

## 2026-05-16 — Build order for the Day-10 portfolio

**Decision:** Ship the three Day-10 builds in this order:
1. RAG application (`rag-app/`)
2. Tool-use agent (`tool-use-agent/`)
3. Evals harness (`evals-harness/`)

**Rationale:** RAG is the most concrete thing to point at in an interview and
has the lowest bar to a working end-to-end loop, so it produces a
LinkedIn-shareable artifact fastest. The tool-use agent reuses the same
provider/SDK setup, lowering incremental cost. The evals harness goes last on
purpose: evals built against a hypothetical system tend to be toy benchmarks,
but evals built against two real artifacts you already shipped are credible.

## 2026-05-16 — Repo layout

**Decision:** Each Day-10 build is a top-level subdirectory: `rag-app/`,
`tool-use-agent/`, `evals-harness/`. The Day-20 teardown PRD lives in
`teardown-prd/`. Fillable interview tracker and resume/cover-letter scaffolds
live in `templates/`.

**Rationale:** Top-level subdirectories keep each artifact one click from the
repo README, which keeps recruiter and interviewer eyes one click from a
working demo. Avoids a nested `src/` or `projects/` layer that adds no value.

## 2026-05-16 — Tech-stack choices are deferred per build

**Decision:** Language, LLM provider, and framework for each build are chosen
in the iteration that starts that build, not pre-committed here.

**Rationale:** The right stack for a RAG demo (e.g. a vector store and a
retrieval loop) is not necessarily the right stack for an evals harness (which
favors a thin test-runner pattern). Pre-committing now locks in choices before
the work informs them, with no upside.

## 2026-05-16 — Teardown target selection is user-gated

**Decision:** The first Day-20 iteration writes `teardown-prd/CANDIDATES.md`
ranking 3 real products from the default pool (Cursor, Linear AI, Notion AI,
Perplexity, GitHub Copilot) with rationale, then pauses for the user to pick.
The teardown PRD itself is drafted only after the user names the target.

**Rationale:** The teardown is the single highest-leverage interview
leave-behind. Its quality depends on the user being able to speak
authentically to the product, which means they need to actually use it. The
agent guessing wrong here wastes a full iteration.

## 2026-05-16 — No fabricated employment history or interview pipeline

**Decision:** Resume, cover-letter, and tracker artifacts are scaffolds with
clearly marked placeholders. The agent does not invent companies the user is
interviewing with, prior roles, projects, or credentials.

**Rationale:** Restated here from OBJECTIVE.md guardrails so it's
unmistakable. Fabricated specifics in a job-search artifact are worse than
useless — they break trust the moment the user reads them and risk leaking
into an external-facing document.

## 2026-05-16 — One complete artifact per iteration

**Decision:** Each iteration ships one complete thing rather than partially
advancing several. "Complete" means: the artifact stands on its own, a future
iteration can extend it without first cleaning it up, and it could be linked
to from the repo README today.

**Rationale:** Half-finished scaffolds across three builds leave nothing to
point at in an interview. One shipped artifact does.

## 2026-05-16 — Tracker vocabulary: stage strings and bucket shorthand

**Decision:** `templates/INTERVIEW_TRACKER.md` uses a fixed stage vocabulary
(`sourced` → `applied` → `recruiter-screen` → `hiring-manager` → `panel` →
`final` → `offer-verbal` → `offer-written` → `accepted`, plus terminal
`rejected` / `withdrew` / `ghosted-30d`) and a `B1` / `B2` / `B3` bucket
shorthand mapping to the scope section of OBJECTIVE.md. Future artifacts
(resume scaffold, cover-letter scaffold, any rollup tooling) reuse these
exact strings.

**Rationale:** A controlled vocabulary lets a future iteration add a rollup
or status command without re-parsing free text, and keeps the user's mental
model consistent across artifacts. Encoding the Bucket 2 priority in the
shorthand (rather than a free-text "AI scope" column) makes the
objective-aligned filter trivial.

## 2026-05-16 — rag-app stack and corpus

**Decision:** The `rag-app/` build is Python 3.11+, generation via the
Anthropic SDK (default model `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, configurable),
embeddings via local `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, an in-memory
NumPy cosine-similarity index, and a single-command CLI
(`python -m rag_app ask "<question>"`). Corpus v1 is the repo's own
markdown (`OBJECTIVE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `templates/INTERVIEW_TRACKER.md`,
`rag-app/README.md`). Corpus v2 (a small set of public AI-PM documents) is
deferred to a later iteration.

**Rationale:** This stack needs exactly one API key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) to
run end-to-end — no vector DB to provision, no second account for hosted
embeddings, no model fine-tuning. Local embeddings cost some retrieval
quality but remove a setup step, which matters more for a demo a recruiter
might watch on a screen share. NumPy beats a vector DB at this scale and
reads cleanly in interviews. Eating the repo's own dog food for corpus v1
sidesteps dataset licensing and lets the demo answer questions about its
own design decisions, which is itself a useful interview moment. The default
Haiku model keeps the per-query cost low enough that the demo can be run
liberally during interviews without budget anxiety.

## 2026-05-16 — rag-app ships incrementally, README first

**Decision:** The `rag-app/` README is shipped before any code. Subsequent
iterations implement: (1) corpus loader + chunker, (2) embedding index,
(3) retrieval CLI, (4) generation with citations, (5) refusal hardening,
(6) eval hooks for `evals-harness/`. Each lands in its own iteration. The
repo root README will only mark `rag-app/` as "demo-ready" once the
end-to-end `ask` slice runs against a real model.

**Rationale:** Locking the design contract in a README before code prevents
re-litigating stack and scope mid-build, which is the single biggest waste
mode for one-iteration-at-a-time work. The README is also a complete
standalone artifact today: it is the PM-framed writeup the objective asks
for, regardless of how much code has landed. The honesty cost — explicitly
labeling the build as "in progress" rather than claiming a working demo —
is paid up front in the README's Status table so the user is never
surprised.

## 2026-05-16 — rag-app chunker: word-based, paragraph-aware, 400/80

**Decision:** The `rag-app/` corpus loader (`python -m rag_app load`)
measures chunk size in **words**, not tokens, with defaults `chunk_words=400`
and `overlap_words=80`. Chunking is paragraph-aware: paragraphs are packed
greedily, never split mid-paragraph, and overlap is carried as whole
trailing paragraphs (not arbitrary word slices). A paragraph longer than
`chunk_words` is emitted as its own oversized chunk rather than mid-split.
Each chunk record carries an `id` (`source::index`), `source` (repo-relative
path), `span` (`[start_char, end_char]` in the source file), `word_count`,
and `text`.

**Rationale:** Token-accurate chunking would require pulling in `tiktoken`
or a model-specific tokenizer, which adds a dependency the loader does not
otherwise need. Word counts are a stable, deterministic, stdlib-only proxy
that is close enough for English markdown of this size; the embedding step
can re-measure in tokens if it ever matters for a model context budget.
Paragraph-level overlap preserves semantic coherence in the carried text
better than arbitrary word-window overlap, which can split mid-sentence.
Emitting char spans (rather than just text) lets the future generation step
resolve citations back to exact source positions for verification.
